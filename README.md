# Open source modules

I've reuploaded some of these since I had long removed my previous GitHub account, so these are back.

## Lua modules

lua_profiler - Fast in-line profiling report for Lua code.

lua_scriptum - General in-line document generation in MarkDown for Lua code. As an example the readme content for this and the lua_profiler module was generated with this module.

lua_serial - Data serialization encode and decode for Lua tables.
